# How it is developed and what is used?
1) fronted is just like website used html css js
2) for backend I have used nodejs express and scraped stock data using cheerio from merolagani

# How to use?
Currently it's not posted in chrome webstore because I can't publish the extension that scrape any site without owner's permission

So, you can just git clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/undef125/nepshareextension.git
```
then from developer option in chromium based browser turn on developer mode and select load unpack option and chooose frontend frolder from that

no need to do anything with backend folder as it is already hosted
